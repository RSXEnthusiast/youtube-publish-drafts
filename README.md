## About
Publish all your draft videos and sort your playlists alphabetically without clicking
![quick demo](youtube-publisher-demo.gif)

## How One Might Use This
If you were to do that (which I'm pretty sure is against YouTube's terms of use, so don't do that) you'd:
1. Edit the script file to meet your needs
2. Go to the applicable page
  a. YouTube Studio Content page for Publishing Drafts
  b. YouTube playlist page for sorting or removing duplicates from playlists - eg [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3bEYn02Mtba_7KLn1pZpAYulTgFow0GH](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3bEYn02Mtba_7KLn1pZpAYulTgFow0GH)
3. Press f12
4. Go to the Console tab
5. Paste the entire contents of the applicable js file
6. Wait

Scripts should work as of last commit.
