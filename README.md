## About
Publish all your draft videos and sort your playlists alphabetically without clicking
![quick demo](youtube-publisher-demo.gif)

## How One Might Use This
If you were to do that (which I'm pretty sure is against YouTube's terms of use, so don't do that) you'd:
1. Edit the script file to meet your needs
1. Go to YouTube Studio's "Content"  page
2. Press f12
3. Paste the entire content of youtube-publish-drafts.js file
4. Wait

It should work as of last commit.
